    "text": "Lesson SAMPLING: the Notion of a Sample\nWe’ve all heard the term margin of error in an opinion poll. It will be discussed in detail in a later lesson, but what question is it addressing?\nSay the poll consists of querying 1200 people, which is common in polls. These were drawn randomly from some list, say a list of phone numbers. We ask each one, “Do you favor Candidate A?” The point is that if we were to do this again, we would get 1200 other people, and the percentage saying Yes to our question would change. Thus we want to have some idea as to how much our Yes percentage varies from one sample of 1200 people to another.\nSampling 1200 people is not referred to as “1200 samples.” The set of 1200 people is referred to as one sample of size 1200.\nLet’s set some notation. Say we are interested in some quantity X, say human height. We take a sample of n people from a given target population, and denote the value of X in the ith person in our sample by Xi. If we sample with replacement (or if n is small relative to the total population size), the Xi are independent random variables. Also, each Xi has distribution equal to that of the sampled population. If, say 22.8% of people in this population are taller than 70 inches, then P(Xi &gt; 70) = 0.228.\nSo, X1,…,Xn are independent, identically distributed random variables (iid)."

    "text": "Lesson NORMALETC: the Role of Normal (Gaussian) and Other Parametric Distribution Families\nIn the last lesson, we talked about the distribution of X in the population. Although the population is finite (more on this below) and thus X is a discrete random variable, one often models X as continuous, with its distribution being in the normal family.\nWhy do this?\n\nHistograms of X in many applications do look rather bell-shaped. This may in turn be due to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT says that sums are approximately normal, and in the human height case, one can think of the body as consisting of chunks whose heights sum to the height of the person. (The CLT assumes i.i.d. summands, and the chunks here would be neither independent nor indentically distributed, but there are non-i.i.d. versions of the CLT.)\nThe early developers of statistics had no computers, and it turns out that the normal distribution family is quite mathematically tractable, thus amenable to closed-form “exact” solutions.\nIt is often the case in math that discrete quantities are approximated by continuous ones (also vice versa).\nA normal distribution is determined by two parameters, the mean and variance of the distribution. Without that assumption, we have many parameters, essentially infinitely many. Let Fx be the cdf of X, i.e. FX(t) = P(X ≤ t). Well, there are infinitely many possible values for t, thus infinitely many values of FX(t). But if we assume X is normal, those infinitely many values are all expressible in terms of just two numbers. We are then essentially estimating two numbers instead of infinitely many. This is often a very useful approximation.\n\nAnother popular model is the exponential distribution family. You probably learned in your probability course that it is “memoryless,” which makes it a suitable model in some applications.\nNote that, as models, these are necessarily inexact. No distribution in practice is exactly normal, for instance. No one is 900 feet tall, and no one has a negative height. For that matter, a normal distribution is continuous, whereas X is discrete, for two reasons:\n\nWe are sampling from a finite population.\nOur measuring instruments have only finite precision. If, say, X is bounded between 0 and 10, and is measured to 2 decimal places, X can take on 1000 values, and thus is discrete.\n\nBut what are we estimating, in light of the fact that our model is only approximate? Say for instance we model X as having a gamma distribution. Then in some sense, depending on how we estimate, we are estimating the gamma distribution that is closest to our true population distribution."

If for instance we run a clinical trial with 100 diabetic patients, we might think of them as having been sampled from the population of all diabetics, even though we did not actually select the patients in our sample, whether randomly or otherwise.\nThis issue can become quite a challenge in, say, economic analysis. If we have 10 years of annual data, i.e. n = 10, what population is that a “sample” from?\nAccordingly, in many applications, the population we model as being sampled from is largely conceptual rather than a tangible entity.\nSay we have 1200 patients in a clinical trial of a drug for treating hypertension. Then our sample might be considered as a random sample of the population of all sufferers of hypertension, but this may be an oversimplification. Serious consideration should be given to the implications of our sampling method on the definition of the sampled population."

    "text": "Lesson STDERRS: Standard Errors\nEarlier we mentioned the “margin of error” in reporting the results of opinion polls. To make that notion concrete, let’s first discuss a related idea, standard errors.\nWe use our data X1,…,Xn to estimate some quantity of interest, say the proportion q of people in the population who would answer Yes to our poll if we had a chance to ask them all. Our estimate, Q, would be the proportion of people in our sample who say Yes.\nExtremely important note: Make sure to always carefully distinguish between a population quantity, q in this case, and its sample estimate, Q here.\nWe want to have some measure of how much Q varies from one sample to another. Of course, Var(Q) is such a measure.\nSay for now that the average of Q, averaged over all possible samples, is q. For some samples, Q &gt; q, for others Q &lt;- q, but on average we get q. This relates to the issue of bias, which we will turn to later, but for now, say we have this situation, i.e. EQ = q.\nThe key point: If Var(Q) is small, then Q doesn’t vary much from one sample to another, and if EQ = q, then for “most” samples, Q should be near q. That is exactly what we hope for! We only have one sample, of course, but if we know that Q is usually near q, we feel reasonably confident that the q from our particular sample is near q.\nOf course, the square root of any variance is called the standard deviation. In the case of an estimator, Q here, we use the term standard error. In some cases, it will be only the approximate standard deviation, in a sense to be seen later."

    "text": "Lesson BIAS: Bias, and Impact on Standard Errors\nIn our last lesson, we assumed that EQ = q. We say that Q is an unbiased estimator of q. In English: The average value of Q over all possible samples is q.\nIn the above example, in which Q is the sample proportion of Yes’s and q is the correspondng population proportion, it does turn out that Q is unbiased. In fact, any sample mean is an unbiased estimator for the population mean.  Let’s skip the derivation for now (we’ll have a derivations lesson later), so we can get to the larger issues.Here X is 1 or 0, with 1 meaning the respondent answered Yes, and 0 meaning No. So the average of the Xi, Q, is the proportion of voters choosing A.\nUnbiasedness at first seems to be a very desirable property. It does hold for some classical statistical methods, but does not hold for many others, one of which is the sample variance, as follows.\nSay we wish to estimate the population variance σ2. (We are not necessarily assuming a normal distribution.) In the population, that is the average squared difference between the data and their mean. The sample analog is\nS2 = (1/n) Σin (Xi - Ā)2\nwhere Ā is the sample mean, (1/n) Σin Xi.\nNote especially the word analog above. Here is the analogy:\n\nσ2 is the average squared distance of X, in the population, to the population mean.\nS2 is the average squared distance of X, in the sample, to the sample mean.\n\nIt can be shown that S2 is biased downward:\nE(S2) = [(n-1) / n] σ2\nThe average value of S2 over all samples is a little too low. The amount of bias is\nE(S2) - σ2 = -1/n σ2\nThis is usually tiny, but it bothered the early developers of statistics, who then adjusted the definition of sample variance to\ns2 = (1/(n-1)) Σin (Xi - Ā)2\nBy the way, in the field of probability and statistics, it is customary to use capital letters for random variables. This is an exception.\nNote our distinction between S2 and the similar but slightly different quantity, s2. Both are random variables–they depend on the Xi, which are random.\nSince for any random variable W (for which EW exists) and any constant c we have E(cW) = c EW, s2 is now unbiased.\nThe variance of Ā turns to be \\(\\sigma^2/n\\)\ns.e.(Ā) = S/n0.5 s.e.(Ā) = S/n0.5\n(use s instead of S if you wish; it won’t matter below).\nBut most estimators are not only biased, but also lack simple adjustments like that for S2 above. So, one must accept bias in general, and consider its implications.\nIn that light, let’s return to the discussion of standard error in the last lesson. We stated that an estimator with small standard error would likely be near the population value it is estimating. But note that now that argument depended on the estimator being unbiased.\nBut the situation is much more optimistic, actually. Say an estimator has bias of size O(1/n), as above. Typically the size of the standard error is O(1/n0.5). In other words, it really doesn’t matter whether we use S or s for larger samples; the bias is small relative to the standard error, so the argument in the last lesson still holds."

    "text": "Lesson CI: Confidence Intervals\nIn our opinion poll example, Q is called a point estimate of q. We would also like to have an interval estimate, which gives a range of values. If say in in an election, the results of an opinion poll are reported as, “Candidate X has support of 62.1% of the voters, with a margin of error of 3.9%,” it is saying,\n\nA 95% confidence interval (CI) for X’s support is (58.2%,66.0%).\n\nWe will show later that the radius of a 95% CI is 1.96 times the standard error of the given estimator Q. By the way, most CIs in this document will be only approximate, a point to be discussed shortly.\nA key point is the meaning of “95% confident.” Imagine forming this interval on each possible sample from the given population. Then 95% of the intervals would cover the true value, q.\nA note on the phrasing “q is in our interval”:\n\nSome may take this to mean that q is random, which it is not; q is unknown but fixed. The CI is what varies from one sample to another. Some instructors are so worried about such misinterpreation that they ban the phrasing “q is in the CI,” insisting that students say “The CI contains q, to emphasize that the CI is random, not q. To me, that’s going to absurd lengths to make a point – the two statements are linquistically equivalent, after all – but again, these instructors feel that misintepretation is less likely this way.\n\nA related, and much deeper, philosophical question is whether it is correct to say, “The probability that q is in this CI is 0.95.” Most statisticians would say that tnis too is an incorrect. They say it violates the view that the 95% figure can only be applied in the “repeated sampling” context. To them, the probability that q is in this CI is either 0 or 1.\nBut really, what do we mean by probability? It depeds on the context. Consider the famous Monty Hall game show problem. To the host, the probability is 1 that the car is behnd door 3. But to the contestant, that probability is 2/3."

    "section": "Lesson CIAPPROX: Confidence Intervals from Asymptotics",
    "text": "Lesson CIAPPROX: Confidence Intervals from Asymptotics\nThe early developers of statistics defined a distribution family known as Student’s t. This supposedly can be used to form “exact” CIs, i.e. the probability of the CI covering the target population value is exactly 0.95, if the population distribution of X is normal. Student-t is widely taught, and thus widely used. BUT it is just an illusion. As pointed out earlier, no distribution in practice is exactly normal.\nWhat saves the day, though, is the Central Limit Theorem. Ā is a (scaled) sum, which the CLT tells us is asymptotically normally distributed as the sample size n goes to infinity.\nTechnically, the CLT is phrased only in terms of cumulative distribution functions, not probability density functions. More on this below, but note that there is also the Local Limit Theorem for density convergence, and in practice, the density functions converge too.\nIn other words, if we were to compute Ā on each of the possible samples of size n from the population, and then plot the results in a histogram, the graph would be approximately bell-shaped, and the probabilities for any range of values would be approximately those of a normal distribution. Moreover, the large n, the more bell-shaped it would be.\nAh, so we’re in business: For any random variable W, the quantity\n(W - EW) / (Var(W)0.5)\nhas mean 0 and variance 1. (This stems simply from the properties of mean and variance; it has nothing to do with whether W is normal or not.) So,\nZ = (Ā - μ) / (σ / n0.5)\nhas mean 0 and variance 1, where μ is the population mean of X. (Recall that Ā is unbiased for μ.)\nAnd since Z actually does have an approximately normal distribution, its distribution is thus approximately N(0,1), i.e. normal with mean 0 and variance 1. Replacing σ, which is unknown. by its estimate s can be further justified mathematically, so in practice\nZ = (Ā - μ) / (s / n0.5)\nis approximately N(0,1), and this is what we exploit to form a CI, as folows.\nThe N(0,1) distribution has 95% of its area between -1.96 and 1.96: e.g. run\nqnorm(0.025)\nSo we have\n0.95 ≈ P[-1.96 &lt; (Ā - μ) / s.e.(Ā) &lt; 1.96]\nwhich after algebra becomes\n0.95 ≈ P[ Ā - 1.96 s.e.(Ā) &lt; μ &lt; Ā + 1.96 s.e.(Ā))\nThere’s our CI for μ!\n(Ā - 1.96 s.e.(Ā), Ā + 1.96 s.e.(Ā))\nWe are (approximately) 95% confident that the true population mean is in that interval. (Remember. it is the interval that is random, not μ.)\nAnd things don’t stop there. Actually, many types of estimators have some kinds of sums within them, and thus have an approximately normal distribution, provided the estimator is a smooth function of those sums.\n(Smooth here means a smooth curve, no sharp corners, thus having a derivative. A Taylor series approximation results in a linear function of normal random variable, thus again normal.)\nThus approximate CIs can be found for lots of different estimators, notably Maximum Likelihood Estimators and least-squares parametric regression estimators, as we will see in later lessons.\nIn other words, we have the following principle:\nThe Fundamental Tool of Statistical Inference:\n(The name here is my own, not a general term, but the principle is widely used.)\n\nIf R is a “smooth” estimator of a population quantity r, and R consists of sums, based on an i.i.d. sample, then an approximate 95% confidence interval for r is\n(R - 1.96 s.e.(R), R + 1.96 s.e.(R))\n\nAgain, the term smooth roughly means that R is a differentiable function of X1, …, Xn.\nBy the way, for large n, the Student-t distribution is almost identical to N(0,1), so “no harm, no foul” – Student-t will be approximately correct. But it won’t be exactly correct, in spite of the claim."

E.g. take any random variable and shift a small amount of its probability mass from X = c to some huge number X = d; almost the same cdf, very different mean.\nAs noted, if a sum is an ingredient in some complicated function that produces our estimator, we can apply a Taylor series argument to say that the estimator is asymptotically normal. But the standard deviation of that normal distribution may be different from that of the estimator itself, due to the inaccuracy of the Taylor approximation.\nSo, the asymptotic statement about regarding R and r above enables us to compute asymptotically valid CIs based on the N(0,1) cdf.

    "text": "Lesson SIG: Significance Testing\nThe notion of signficance testing (ST) (also known as hypothesis testing, and p-values) is one of the real oddities in statistics.\n\nOn the one hand, statisticians are well aware of the fact that ST can be highly miseadling.\nBut on the other hand, they teach ST with little or no warning about its dangers. As a result, its use is widespread–or more accurately stated, entrenched.\n\nAs mentioned, the problems of ST have always been well-known, but nothing was done about them. Finally, in 2016, the American Statistical Association released its first-ever position paper on any topic, stating what everyone had known for decades: ST is just not a good tool.\nTo be sure, the ASA stopped short of recommending fully against ST, as some on the committee were defenders of it to some extent. The final statement did vaguely say ST is useful in some settings. But they gave no examples of this, and at the very least agreed that ST is indeed widely misused. But it is my position that ST should simply not be used at all. Instead, analysis should be based on CIs, as explained later in this lesson.\nBut first, what is ST? To keep things simple, let’s say we have some coin, and want to test the null hypothesis H0: r = 0.5, where r is the probability of heads. We will toss the coin n times, and set R to the proportion of heads in our sample.\nWe take an “innocent until proven guilty” approach, clinging to our belief in H0 until/unless we see very strong evidence to the contrary. Well, what constitutes “strong”?\nWe look at the ratio W = (R-0.5) / s.e.(R). R is approximately normal, as noted earlier, and under H0 R has mean 0. So under H0, W ~ N(0,1). (Tilde is standard notation for “distributed as.”) Then P(|W| &gt; 1.96) ≈ 0.05 and 5% is the traditional standard for “strong evidence.” We reject H0 if and only if |W| &gt; 1.96.\nAnd we can get greedy. What if, say, we find that R = 2.2? Note:\n&gt; pnorm(-2.2)\n[1] 0.01390345\nUnder H0, P(|W| &gt; 2.2) ≈ 0.028. Ah, we would have rejected H0 even under the more stringent “strong evidence” criterion of 0.028. So we report 0.028, known as the p-value. The smaller the p-value, the more signficant we declare our finding.\nWell, what’s wrong with that?\n\nWe know a priori that H0 is false. No coin is exactly balanced. So it’s rather silly to ask the question regarding H0.\nWe might be interested in knowing whether the coin is approximately balanced. Fine, but the ST is not addressing that question. Even if r is just a little different from 0, then as the number of tosses n goes to infinity, the denominator in W goes to 0, and thus R goes to ±∞–and the p-value goes to 0.\nIn such a scenario, we declare that the coin is “signficantly” unbalanced (“Look, a tiny p-value!”), an egregiously misleading statement.\nWe have the opposite problem with small n. We will declare “No signficant difference” when we actually should say, “We have too little data to make any claims.”\n\nOne reason that ST is so appealing is that it allows the user to be lazy. Say we have two drugs, an old one A and a new one B, for treating high blood pressure. The user here may be a government agency, deciding whether to approve the new drug.\nLet μa and μb denote the population mean effects of the two drugs. Then the null hypothesis is\nH0: μa = μb\nAgain, we know a priori that H0 must be false–the two means can’t be equal, to infinitely many decimal places–so the test is meaningless in the first place, and we will have the problems described above. But, forget all that–the test gives us an answer, and the user is happy.\nA more careful analysis would be based on forming a CI for the difference μa - μb. That gives us a range of values, against which we can weigh things like cost differences between the two drugs, possible side effects and so on. In addition, the width of the interval gives the user an idea as to whether there is enough data for accurate estimation of the means.\nYes, the user does have to make a decision, but it is an informed decision. In other words:\n\nThe user is taking responsibility, making an informed decision, instead of allowing a poor statistical procedure to make the decision for him/her.\n\nNote by the way that what we are NOT doing is “check to see whether the CI contains 0,” which would have all the problems cited above.\nSee this document for further details."

Technically, all random variables in real life are discrete rather than continuous, e.g. because of the finite precision of our measuring instruments.\nThus phrasing like “the” pdf above really means the pdf that best approximates the true population distribution. But from here on, let’s just speak of estimating “the” pdf.\nHistograms are pdf estimators:\nActually, the familiar histogram is a pdf estimator, provided we specify that the total area under it is 1.0. Here’s why:\nFirst, consider a histogram for the geyser data:\nhist(erps,probability=TRUE)  # second argument indicates area = 1.0\n\n\n\nalt text\n\n\nHistograms involve partitioning the range of the data into a certain number of bins (which can be specified with the breaks argument in hist()).\nLet’s look a little closer:\n&gt; u &lt;- hist(erps,probability=TRUE)\n&gt; u\n$breaks\n[1] 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5\n\n$counts\n[1] 55 37  5  9 34 75 54  3\n...\nHere hist() gave us the default bin boundaries for this data, at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and so on. We see that for instance 37 values of the erps fell into the interval from 2.0 to 2.5. This 37 figure was then used to determine the height of the plot for this interval. Why?\nRecall that the pdf of X, denoted by fX, is the derivative of the cdf FX. Recall too that a derivative is the slope of the tangent line to a curve. This in turn is a limit of slopes of line segments (secant lines) between two points on the curve.\nHere is an illustration. We drew the N(0,0.5) cdf, and then the tangent line at x = 0.5, as well as the secant line from x = 0.5 to x = 1.0.\n\n\n\nalt text\n\n\nHere is the code:\ncurve(pnorm(x,0,0.5),-2.5,2.5)\n# draw secant line from x = 0.5 to x = 1\npoint1 &lt;- c(0.5,pnorm(0.5,0,0.5))\npoint2 &lt;- c(1.0,pnorm(1.0,0,0.5))\npoint12 &lt;- rbind(point1,point2)\nlines(point12[,1],point12[,2])\n# abline() slope s at (q,r)\nabscd &lt;- function(q,r,s) abline(r-s*q,s)\nabscd(0.5,pnorm(0.5,0,0.5),dnorm(0.5,0,0.5))\nAs you can see, the secant slope is considerably less than the tangent slope. But if we were to draw the secant from x = 0.5 to say, x = 0.6, the tangent and secant slopes would be more similar.\nSo, for an interval (a,b), with b-a small,\nfX(a) ≈ [FX(b) - FX(a)] / (b-a)\nFX(b) - FX(a) is the probability that X is in (a,b], which we can estimate from the data, say for a = 2.0 and b = 2.5:\n&gt; sum(2.0 &lt; erps & erps &lt;= 2.5)\n[1] 37\n&gt; sum(2.0 &lt; erps & erps &lt;= 2.5) / length(erps)\n[1] 0.1360294\nHere (b-a) = 2.5 - 2.0 = 0.5. So,\nfX(2.0) ≈ 0.1360294 / 0.5 = 0.2720588\nSo, it makes sense that our histogram, viewed as a density estimate, used that 37 counts value. The rest, i.e. dividing by the total number of data points 272 times the interval width 0.5, just enter in to make the total area 1.0, which a density must have. As we saw above, we can request this latter property via the probability argument:\nIt’s only approximate!\nNote carefully that the symbol ≈ above stems from two considerations:\n\nWe are approximating a tangent by a secant.\nWe are using an estimate of FX from our sample data, not the population. We return to this point shortly.\n\n&gt; hist(erps,probability=TRUE)\nBut we’re not done. Why have an interval width (bin width) of 0.5? It came as the hist() default (which actually set the number of intervals). Maybe the intervals should be shorter? Longer? We have this tradeoff:\n\nIf we make b-a too small, we won’t have enough data to get a good estimate.\nIf we make b-a too large, then the approximation\nfX(a) ≈ [FX(b) - FX(a)] / (b-a)\nwill not be accurate.\n\nWe will return to this point later, in Lesson TRADE.\nKeeping this approximate nature in mind, it is interesting to note that our histogram here is bimodal, i.e. has two peaks. There have been many geophysical theories on this, e.g. postulating that there are two kinds of eruptions.\nHistograms are considered rather crude estimators of a density, as they are so choppy. A more advanced approach is that of kernel density estimators.\nIn estimating the density at a given point t, kernel estimators work by placing more weight on the data points that are closer to t, with the weights being smooth functions of the distance to t. A smooth curve results.\nBut what does “close” mean? Just as histograms have a tuning parameter (called a hyperparameter in machine learning circles) in the form of the bin width, kernel estimators have something called the bandwidth. Let’s not go into the formula here, but the point is that smaller bandwidths yield a more peaked graph, while larger values produce flatter curves.\nHere are the graphs for bandwidths of 0.25 and 0.75:\nplot(density(erps,bw=0.25))\nplot(density(erps,bw=0.75))\n\n\n\nalt text\n\n\n\n\n\nalt text\n\n\nThe first graph seems to clearly show 2 bells, but the second one is rather ambiguous. With even larger values for the bandwidth (try it yourself), we see a single bell, no hint of 2.\nHow should we choose the bandwidth, or for that matter, the bin width? if we make the bandwidth too large, some important “bumps” may not be visible. On the other hand, if we make it too small, this will just expose sampling variability, thus displaying “false” bumps.\nWe’ll address this (but unfortunately not answer it) next."
